"""Backwards-compatible shim for the pre-registry chapter helper.

Before the shared registry existed, three chapter experiments each carried
their own copy of ``resolve_llm_backend``. It is still imported by three
chapter modules and called by two of them, so it stays until all of them are
migrated:

* ``chapter1/web-search-agent/agent.py`` -- calls it
* ``chapter1/learning-from-experience/llm_agent.py`` -- calls it
* ``chapter1/context/config.py`` -- re-exports it for its own importers

Deleting this function therefore breaks ``chapter1/context`` at import time
even though that module never calls it.

It cannot simply delegate to :func:`~agentbook.providers.resolution.resolve_backend`:
callers pass a bare ``base_url`` with no provider name, which the registry has
no way to express. What it *can* share is the OpenRouter construction, so the
two code paths cannot drift apart on the part that matters.

    the provider registry and therefore reports far better errors. This exists

    Args:
