# Experiment 10-3 · Autonomous phone/browser orchestration

This is the autonomous arm of Chapter Experiment 10-3. Its retained validation
artifacts and validators use the current `10-3` identifier; the fixed-topology
comparison is kept in [`talkact-reproduction`](../talkact-reproduction/) under
the same chapter experiment number.

This companion implements the autonomous arm of the merged experiment. A real Playwright Computer Use Agent opens an arbitrary registration URL and inspects the rendered form. A real LLM sees the page observation, known user context, and an optional `initiate_phone_call_agent(purpose, required_info)` tool. With `tool_choice=auto`, the model—not a Python field-count rule—decides whether to spawn a Phone Agent.

The default transport is a private local WebRTC call (`--phone-transport webrtc`). It opens a participant page, negotiates an offer/answer pair, and carries agent and participant audio on two RTP tracks. Agent prompts also cross a data channel as non-sensitive captions; answers never use that channel. The remote peer records the participant track ephemerally for ASR, then discards both media and transcript. No E.164 number, PSTN provider, tunnel, or public webhook is required. The old Twilio and direct-microphone transports remain optional.

## Exact concurrency and failure behavior

- Phone and Computer Agents run as independent `asyncio` tasks with separate loops.
- Each valid spoken value immediately emits `info_collected`; the Phone Agent asks the next question without awaiting `field_filled`.
- The Computer Agent fills the actual page concurrently. `timing_evidence.overlap_checks` proves whether “ask next” preceded the prior fill completion.
- HTML types, patterns, options, and format hints become `FieldSpec` validators. Invalid speech emits `format_invalid`, gives precise feedback, and is re-asked up to three times.
- Page/selector errors are returned as `fill_error`; submission is blocked when any error remains.
- Any unexpected Phone/Computer exception cancels the still-running peer, closes the
  call and all media tracks, and then lets the top-level `finally` close the browser.
  Cleanup is idempotent on normal and exceptional exits.
- `--submit` is opt-in so a demonstration cannot accidentally create an account.
- The decision and every message timestamp are written to JSON. Spoken personal values are redacted from console and disk traces.

## Setup and local WebRTC call

```bash
cd chapter10/autonomous-phone-registration
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
cp env.example .env

python demo.py --confirm-consent --url 'https://your-site.example/register'
```

The command opens both the target form and a local participant call page. Speak after
each question, then click **Finish answer**. Localhost is a browser secure context, so
microphone access works without a certificate. The program refuses to open any live
audio path unless `--confirm-consent` is present; the focused suite verifies that the
refusal occurs before constructing a browser or media channel.

Speech provider selection is independent of WebRTC. `WEBRTC_SPEECH_PROVIDER=auto`
prefers local `say`/`espeak` TTS plus Gemini ASR when those are configured, otherwise
it uses OpenAI TTS/ASR. `local-whisper` keeps both stages local and requires
`openai-whisper` plus a cached/downloadable checkpoint:

```bash
WEBRTC_SPEECH_PROVIDER=local-whisper \
WHISPER_PYTHON=/path/to/python-with-whisper \
WHISPER_MODEL=tiny \
python demo.py --confirm-consent --url 'https://your-site.example/register'
```

`--submit` remains an explicit opt-in. Without it, the agents fill and validate the
form but do not create an account. The full acceptance runner submits only to its own
localhost endpoint.

Optional legacy transports:

```bash
python demo.py --confirm-consent --phone-transport local --url 'https://demoqa.com/automation-practice-form'
python demo.py --confirm-consent --phone-transport twilio --url 'https://demoqa.com/automation-practice-form'
```

## Tests and full acceptance

```bash
pytest -q

# Real LLM + Playwright + WebRTC/RTP + TTS/ASR + localhost submission.
# Values are safe synthetic data; they still cross the audio media path and ASR.
WEBRTC_SPEECH_PROVIDER=local-whisper \
WHISPER_PYTHON=/path/to/python-with-whisper \
python run_acceptance.py

# Recompute every retained hash and prove raw ARK request/response consistency.
python validate_acceptance.py \
  validation/runs/exp10-3-webrtc-raw-20260731-v4
```

The formal 2026-07-31 run is committed at
[`validation/runs/exp10-3-webrtc-raw-20260731-v4/`](validation/runs/exp10-3-webrtc-raw-20260731-v4/).
A real ARK response (ID and usage retained) autonomously selected six required fields.
The call completed one offer, one answer, seven media recordings, 9 TTS turns and 7
local Whisper turns. Both RTP directions carried packets and bytes. A deliberately
invalid spoken email caused `format_invalid` and a second question; all five adjacent
ask/fill intervals overlapped; exactly one redacted six-field submission reached the
localhost endpoint. All 9 acceptance gates pass. The manifest binds the runtime and
artifacts with SHA-256 hashes, and the secret/value scan is empty. In addition to the
normalized decision, this run retains the credential-free raw ARK request and raw
response. They preserve the literal `tool_choice: "auto"`, tool schema, tool-call
arguments, response ID, model, usage and measured latency. The standalone validator
recomputes source, input and artifact hashes, independently normalizes those raw
arguments against the observed form, and requires exact equality with `decision.json`.
Its 8/8 retained-evidence checks pass; tamper tests cover the raw response, normalized
decision, manifest and an unexpected unbound artifact.

This run uses a safe synthesized participant so it is automated and reproducible. It
proves the real media, ASR, orchestration, validation, privacy, and submission paths;
it is not a human usability study or a test of TURN/NAT traversal. A human call uses
the same WebRTC path with `--webrtc-answers-json` omitted.

## 中文说明

本项目实现实验 10-3 的自主模式：Playwright Computer Use Agent 先访问真实注册页并读取表单；真实 LLM 在 `tool_choice=auto` 下自主决定是否调用 `initiate_phone_call_agent(purpose, required_info)`，代码没有用“字段数大于 N”代替模型决策。固定拓扑的并发基线见同章的 TalkAct 复现记录；两条路径的项目入口、验证器和保留产物均统一使用当前编号 10-3。

默认路径现在是本机浏览器 WebRTC 通话，不需要手机号、PSTN 服务商、公开 webhook 或隧道。页面会完成真实 offer/answer，并用双向 RTP 音轨传输 Agent 语音和用户麦克风；回答只从远端音轨的临时录音进入 ASR，不会通过文本通道旁路，也不会保留原始音频或 transcript。Phone Agent 每拿到一个有效值就立即发给 Computer Agent，然后直接问下一项，不等待网页填写完成；格式错误会反馈并重问，页面错误会阻止提交，`--submit` 仍须显式授权。

正式 raw-v4 验收以安全合成参与者跑通真实 ARK 自主工具调用、Playwright、WebRTC/RTP、本机 TTS、真实本机 Whisper ASR、格式重问、问填并行和一次 localhost 表单提交：9/9 行为门禁通过。除规范化 decision 外，证据还保留不含凭据的 ARK 原始请求和响应，包含字面量 `tool_choice: "auto"`、工具参数、response ID、model、usage 与实测延迟。独立 validator 会重算源码、输入和产物 hash，并把原始工具参数独立规范化后与 `decision.json` 精确比较；8/8 溯源检查及 raw receipt、decision、manifest、未绑定额外产物四类篡改测试均通过。日志只保留 `<redacted>`，不保留参与者值、音频或 transcript。这证明完整技术链路，不等同于真人可用性或跨 NAT/TURN 测试；省略 `--webrtc-answers-json` 即进入同一媒体路径的真人麦克风模式。
